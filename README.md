# hypothesis-testing-groups-v12



The 12th version of an Otree-Experiment, used to investigate group-strategies in hypothesis-testing (Klayman, & Ha, 1988). 
Participants get assigned to groups of two "on the fly", leading them to collectively searching for information regarding police violence in Germany. 
Groups are instructed to sample information (either supporting the existence of police violence or disproving) in order to give an evaluation of the problem. 
We used Otree, a survey-tool by Chen et al. (2016). 

Experiment is in German.
